## About

DashExpress is a wrapper over the Plotly Dash web framework, which allows you to simplify and speed up the creation of multi-page analytical applications based on data from pd.DataFrame.

The key features are:

* **High Performance**: Provided by built-in optimization methods of Dash callback functions.
* **Fast to code**: Using a pre-configured UI and automatically generated callback functions.
* **Based on Pandas**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
* **Used Mantine UI**: Pretty UI by Mantine React Library
* **Include Dark Theme**: Use a dark theme for all components (including graphs and maps) without any additional actions.
