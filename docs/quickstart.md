# Introduction to DashExpress

This quick tutorial introduces the key concepts and basic features of DashExpress to help you get started with your projects.

## Concepts
Dash Express, as the name suggests, extends the popular web framework Plotly Dash, by adding responsive UI and generated automatic callback-functions. If you are not familiar with Dash, we recommend taking a quick look at its Getting started documentation before proceeding.

The logic of creating a Dash Express application, like any dashboard, comes down to 4 stages:

1. Data collection
2. Creating a layout
3. Filling layouts with visualizations
4. Adding filtering

Dash Express simplifies the second and fourth stages. The concept of Dash Express implies the rejection of the need to write callback functions. Despite the fact that writing such functions as a rule does not present any difficulty, it can be very tedious in the case of a large number of visualizations and (or) frequent changes in layout and content.
