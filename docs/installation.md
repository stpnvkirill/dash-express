This also brings along the `Plotly Dash`, `Pandas`, `Dash Mantine Components` & `Dash Leaflet` . This library is under active development, so install and upgrade frequently.

We also recommend installing GeoPandas, which is required by Generated Geojson for leaflet maps and used in many of our examples.
